## The Challenge
            
I decided to challenge myself to make a falling block game similar to TetrisÂ® using only C++ and SDL. I chose C++ because it is the language most commonly used in the video games industry, because I am familiar with it,
and because I enjoy working with it. I chose SDL because I feel like the abstractions it provides are enough to avoid some of the fiddliness of writing cross-platform code, but still doesn't get in the way or do too much for you.
                        
My initial goal was simple: to create a functional Tetris style game in a weekend.
            

## The Plan

I'm a huge fan of Tetris, so I had a good idea of my requirements right from the start. I wanted more or less these features:        



* Basic Tetris functionality

    + 10x20 board
    + Movement of pieces from left to right
    + Rotation of pieces
    + Gravity to pull pieces down
    + <a href="https://harddrop.com/wiki/Drop#Soft_drop">Soft drop</a>
    + <a href="https://harddrop.com/wiki/Drop#Hard_drop">Hard drop</a>
* <a href="https://harddrop.com/wiki/SRS">SRS</a> style rotation
* <a href="https://harddrop.com/wiki/Random_Generator">Random bag</a> based piece randomization
* Hold Piece
* Ghost piece
* Scoring system
* Level system (difficulty increase over time)


    
## Initial implementation

    During the first weekend, I managed to implement most of the basic features.
